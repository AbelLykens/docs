Google Tasks```

### Grant the contacts permission (Android 6 + 7 only)

Tasks requires the `contacts` permission on versions of Android prior to 8.0.
This permission is needed to access the Google accounts registered on your
device

### Choose an account

Select the Google account that you would like to synchronize with. A
[subscription](subscribe.md) is required to synchronize with two or more Google
accounts

### Grant OAuth 2.0 access

Tasks requires permission to use the Google Task web API with your account. If
you no longer use Google Task synchronization you may revoke this permission by
visiting your Google [security
settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

**Please note:** Tasks.org will be flagged in your Google Security Checkup
because I am unverified developer. Unfortunately it costs approximately
$15,000-75,000 USD to get verified, so this situation is unlikely to change
