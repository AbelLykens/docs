[Google Tasks](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/106237) is a basic task list service provided by Google. Google Tasks can be accessed from GMail, Google Calendar, [mobile](https://www.gmail.com/tasks) and [desktop](https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas) web interfaces, or a variety of third party clients.

Tasks can synchronize a portion of its data through Google Tasks. Given the limited amount of information supported by Google Tasks you will only be able to synchronize the following:

* Title
* Due date (without time of day)
* Description

No other data can be synchronized through Google Tasks

### Additional features

* Re-order tasks and create subtasks using [manual sort mode](manual_sort_mode.md)
* Create, rename, and delete Google Task lists
* Move tasks between Google Task lists
