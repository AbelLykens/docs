[Google Tasks](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/106237) is a basic
task list service provided by Google. Google Tasks can be accessed from GMail,
Google Calendar, or a variety of third party clients.

Tasks can synchronize a portion of its data through Google Tasks. Given the
limited amount of information supported by Google Tasks you will only be able
to synchronize the following:

* Title
* Due date ([without time of day](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/128979662))
* Description

No other data can be synchronized through Google Tasks

### Recurrence, reminders, and due times

Recurrence, reminders, and due times were added to the Google Tasks service in
early 2019. Unfortunately the third-party Google Tasks API did not receive a
similar update, so this data is not available to third-party clients like Tasks.

### Additional features

* Re-order tasks and create subtasks using [manual sort
  mode](manual_sort_mode.md)
* Create, rename, and delete Google Task lists
* Move tasks between Google Task lists
