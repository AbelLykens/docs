---

CalDAV [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV)] is an Internet standard for client access to scheduling information on a remote server. CalDAV is typically used for synchronizing calendars with services such as Google Calendar and Apple's iCloud Calendar, however the CalDAV protocol also includes a specification for to-do list entries.

You can synchronize Tasks with a variety of proprietary or open source calendar servers. Visit [Choosing a provider](caldav_create_account.md) for more details.
