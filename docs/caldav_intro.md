CalDAV [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV)] is an open Internet
standard for synchronizing calendar events and task lists.  Tasks can
synchronize with a variety of CalDAV servers. Set up a free or paid account
with a third party service, or host your own from a selection of open-source
servers

The following is not an exhaustive list of compatible services. If any services
are missing, outdated, or incorrect, please [send me an e-mail](mailto:support@tasks.org), or open a pull request at
