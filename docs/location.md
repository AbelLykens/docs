## Location picker

You can choose to use either Google Maps\* or Mapbox tiles. `Select this location` will use Mapbox for reverse-geocoding

## Location search

Tasks can perform location autocomplete searches using Google Places\* or Mapbox. Autocomplete search results are biased to the center of the visible map area

Google Places search results include business phone numbers and website URLs. Tasks will provide shortcuts for this additional data. Google charges money for every Google Places search, so this functionality is only available to subscribers

## Location-based reminders\*

Tasks can notify you when you arrive and/or depart from a location

* You must grant permission to access your location in order to use location-based reminders
* Android Q users must grant permission to access your location in the background.

\* Only available when Tasks is installed from the Google Play Store. Requires Google Play Services.
